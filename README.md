Affordable Housing Data Project

The Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) reports on
projects, buildings, and units that began after January 1, 2014, and are counted
towards either the Housing New York plan (1/1/2014 – 12/31/2021) or the Housing
Our Neighbors: A Blueprint for Housing & Homelessness plan (1/1/2022 – present).
